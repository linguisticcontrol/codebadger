# 🦡 codebadger Documentation

codebadger is a containerized **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that gives
AI agents and LLMs deep, queryable access to a codebase's structure and data flow
through [Joern](https://joern.io/) Code Property Graphs (CPGs). Point it at a Git
repository, a local path, or a pasted code snippet, and it builds a CPG and
exposes it as LLM-callable tools for running CPGQL queries, tracing data flow and
taint, slicing programs, and hunting vulnerabilities — across Java, C/C++,
JavaScript, Python, Go, Kotlin, C#, Ghidra, Jimple, PHP, Ruby, and Swift. It
serves both general **program analysis** and **vulnerability analysis**, for
**academic research** and **industry** alike.

These docs are for two audiences:

- **Developers** deploying, operating, or extending the server.
- **Security researchers** using the tools to hunt vulnerabilities and build PoCs.
